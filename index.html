            Try to run first thing in the morning before your day gets busy. Or,
            run during your lunch break. Look for run clubs and running meetups
            in your area for support and motivation. Do short runs during the
            week, and save your long runs for the weekends when you have more
            time.

        Keep it simple “Establishing a new habit is easier if you start with a
        simple change, then build in complexity over time,” says sport and
        exercise psychologist Helen O’Connor (@psycurious). “For the first few
        mornings, set your alarm for 6am, get up, put your kit on and walk or
        run around the block. Once you’re used to the early start, build up the
        distance.”

        Experiment with food Some people wake up hungry, in which case a small
        snack – a banana or half a piece of toast and peanut butter – should see
        you through a short run. Others find they don’t need anything except a
        glass of water. A 2010 study showed that running in a fasted state
        (before breakfast) helps maintain a healthy waistline more than running
        after breakfast.

        Lay out your kit “Instead of having your slippers by the bed, lay out
        your running kit – trainers, socks, trousers, top and jacket,” says
        Helen. Once you’re dressed in it, there’s no going back, but if you
        shuffle downstairs in your slippers and PJs, the temptation to crawl
        back under the duvet is too big. Ensure that your kit is warm and
        hi-vis, so that you can be seen by cars, cyclists and pedestrians.

          You know what you want from your running shoes: light weight,
          cushioning, support, and a comfortable fit. Of course, the most
          important part of any running shoe is your experience over the
          hundreds of miles you’ll take it on. To help you find your next great
          pair, and to get a sense of how updates to your favorite road or trail
          shoe may change how it fits or performs, we review hundreds of men’s
          and women’s running shoes each year. Scroll down for reviews of our
          top picks, a look at how we test and select these models, and helpful
          buying tips and insight from our gear experts.
